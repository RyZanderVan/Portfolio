	<p>On July 14th 2014 a terrible burden was unleashed on YouTube. Thankfully it was witnessed by, admittedly, very few people overall. But never-the-less that was the day the first video was published by myself under my North Saint Podcast channel. The videos were made wherever I was currently living at the time with the help of various friends and family including my now wife. After capturing the audio and game footage I then hastily and poorly edited everything togethter to their final forms, some of which I have posted below. They were usually riddled with audio mistakes, editing errors, and not funny commentary, but we continued anyway. Well, that is until getting 5 or 6 people together to play video games became too much of a hassle. The last video was uploaded on March 2nd of 2019, bringing to an end an almost 5 year saga where 69 different videos were uploaded, each averaging maybe 10 - 20 views each. And I would guess most of those views were me.</p><br>

		<p><blockquote>This was the first video we ever uploaded to the channel, the original Dark Souls for the Xbox 360. This is actually the game that incepted the idea in my head to try my hand at a Let's Play style YouTube channel. Just sitting around watching my younger brother troll people online in Dark Souls. Published on July, 14th 2014 it currently stands at 140 views, our most viewed video ever.</p></blockquote>

		<p><blockquote>This was one of my favorite videos as it was the first time that the only people playing were the female members of our recording team. In episode 25 the girls ended up playing Resident Evil Revelations 2 on the Xbox One and it was actually the last video that we posted that cracked 30 views, even though it was the 25th overall video we posted out of sixtynine. Published on April 15th 2015 it currently stands at 38 views</p></blockquote>

		<p><blockquote>This is the final video that was posted to the account, episode sixtynine where we played the 2019 remake of Resident Evil 2 on the Xbox One. The final episode published to the channel was actually released almost a full year after it's predecessor and was my last attempt to see if this hobby had any staying power as doing all of the work myself was not only taxing but also boring. It is hard t believe that is was released all the way back in 2018. It is not very surprising that it currently sits at 8 views.</p></blockquote><br>
